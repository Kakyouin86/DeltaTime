1.9.0	:	2017-02-07
		-	Added Earths moon - please send me your feedback for improvement. Moon prefab is 3D only.
		-	Clouds work better in linear color space
		-	Reduce dithering in linear color space
		-	Additional particle system performance tuning, especially with collisions in 3D mode
		-	Multiple misc. bug fixes

1.8.1	:	2017-02-04
		-	Tweak sky sphere storm cloud appearance
		-	Added sharpness parameter to show clouds animated function
		-	Changed snow, sleet and rain collision particles to be a little smaller
		-	Blank demo scene now has proper skybox and lighting
		-	Added additional warnings and error messages
		-	Moved rain and sleet particles to vertical billboard using new Unity x,y,z sizing

1.8.0	:	2017-01-31
		-	Vastly improve storm cloud performance. Storm clouds are integrated into the sky sphere now. See the configuration script for an example.
		-	Old storm clouds are still available via CloudScript parameter on WeatherMakerScript.
		-	Improved particle system performance
		-	Added sky sphere cloud density parameter. This increases the alpha (opaqueness) of the clouds.
		-	Added density, whispiness and color to sky sphere show clouds animated function.

1.7.4	:	2017-01-24
		-	Ambient colors and intensity available in sky sphere script for day, dawn/dusk and night

1.7.3	:	2017-01-15
		-	Full screen fog works in VR properly now with blur and/or downsampling

1.7.2	:	2017-01-11
		-	Additional fixes for VR

1.7.1	:	2017-01-06
		-	Fixed sound issue with wind
		-	Support VR for volumetric fog
		-	Fix performance issue with storm clouds
		-	Fix a bug where lightning lights didn't get removed from the light manager
		-	Remove cloud thickness parameter, as sun intensity reduction is now based on the cloud cover parameter
		-	EnablePerPixelLighting is now a property of WeatherMakerScript
		-	Improved sky sphere cloud appearance at horizon

1.7		:	2017-01-05
		-	Add night sky star twinkling options
		-	Add RotateYDegrees parameter to day night cycle, useful if you want something besides an East/West cycle
		-	Sun dims slightly when heavy sky sphere clouds are created
		-	Sun shadows fade out when storm clouds are created
		-	Lightning bolt generation is now done in a background thread
		-	Refactored the wind component, making it easier to get or set the wind parameters

1.6		:	2016-12-22
		-	Added procedural clouds to the sky sphere. They are lit up the same way as the sky. See readme.txt and sky sphere script for implementation details.
		-	Configuration panel now has 5 types of cloud options: None, Light, Medium, Heavy, Storm.
		-	Added a night speed to the day night script. Now you can make the night go faster or slower than the day easily.

1.5.2	:	2016-11-30
		-	Added dithering to particles to eliminate banding in low-light conditions
		-	Added secondary particle system option. Right now only rain uses this for a torrential rain effect. Other precipitation will get secondary particle systems soon.
		-	Added mesh creation properties for particle systems for 3D mode. You can determine the near and far width and depth of the mesh the particles fall from if you desire.
		-	Lots of bug fixes!

1.5.1	:	2016-11-28
		-	Added a prefab for volumetric fog cube. I'm still working on getting the noise just right, but it's a good start :)

1.5.0	:	2016-11-17
		-	Added full screen fog effect. This has lots of configuration options, so be sure to watch the tutorial video specified in the readme.txt file
		-	Moved weather maker prefabs into a prefab sub folder
		-	Fix banding in sky sphere in procedural modes

1.4.0	:	2016-10-16
		-	Added procedural sky and procedural textured sky options to sky sphere, see details in the sky sphere section.
		-	Added a sun option to sky sphere - high quality, fast or none, see details in the sky sphere section.

1.3.0	:	2016-9-24
		-	Change how time of day works - it is now a property (seconds) on the day night cycle script. Sun rotation is based on time of day instead of time of day being based off sun rotation now.
		-	Added lat / lon, timezone and day/month/year properties to day night cycle for accurate sun positions and seasons. See "WeatherMakerDayNightCycleScript.cs" for more details.
		-	Small tweaks to make asset easier to jump right into.
		-	Fade directional light in/out as it dips below or above the horizon.

1.2.0	-	Added a dawn / dusk texture and fade degrees to the sky sphere script.
1.1.3	-	Added a volume property to globally change the volume of all precipitation, wind and thunder sounds.
1.1.2	-	Fixes for particle emission : each precipitation has a new emission rate property that is multiplied by intensity.
1.1.1	-	Small bug fix to 2D particle collisions.
			Toggle the configuration panel with Ctrl-`.
1.1.0	-	Added day / night cycle with time of day, and sun texture.
1.0.0	-	Initial Release.
